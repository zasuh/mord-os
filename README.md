# üßê MORD OS

## Getting Started üó∫Ô∏è

Run `npm install` and then either `npm start` or `yarn start` to build the application. The application runs on port 3000.

To login use `borgoth@mordos.com` as the email and `12bindthem`. The credentials save into session storage. The user cannot access the home or `/` page untill he/she authenticates through the `/login` screen.

## Features üïπÔ∏è

### File Directory üìÅ

The file directory app opens with 5 mocked text files and an "Add" button which a user can use to add new entries into the list. Each column can be sorted by clicking on the column header. Clicking multiple times changes the sorting from ascending / descending.

The "Add" button opens a sidebar where there is a Title and Content input. The user can use these to enter a new entry. Every row in the list is clickable which allows the user to either edit the title/content or deleting the file entirely.

### Image Gallery üñºÔ∏è

The image gallery app is split into two sections, one being the navigation sidebar where the user can switch from viewing all the pictures in the system, to viewing just the json placeholder endpoint images and viewing the pictures taken with the camera app.

### Camera App üì∑

The camera app is simple, but integrates with the gallery app. Once opened the app will load a webcam if it's available. The user can then take a picture. The pictures are stored in session storage and can be seen in the Gallery app under "All Images" or "Webcam Images".

### RSS Reader üì∞

The RSS Reader app shows a collection of mocked posts and json placeholder posts. Again like the image gallery app the user can view both mocked and placeholder posts or each one individually.

### Browser üîç

Browsing through Google search can be done use the built in Browser app. It's a simple application imitating Google search where the user can enter a search query and have another tab open with the search run through Google.

### Desktop Toolbar üß∞

The bottom toolbar has a start icon and a search icon imitating the Windows OS. It also has some icons to the right side along with a clock which shows local time. When an app/modal is opened it will display in the bottom bar as though it would in Windows.

## Improvements & ideas ‚ú®

There are some (but definetly not all) ideas/improvements that would enrich the overall user experience even more if this were to be a real life case. The items marked with an emoji are points where I only have a vague idea how to implement it and would probably require a second or more experienced person to either give me ideas or help me with them.

As stated above this list isn't exhaustive nor is the app perfect. I realize that and hopefully what I've produced shows my level of knowledge.

### Ideas

- ‚úã *Backend implementation*: Implementing a backend would obviously be the first step. Enabling more complete and precise authentication and authorization, saving data to a database and retrieving it without having to utilize session storage.

- *Unified styling*: I tried to keep the design simple and consistent. There are things I don't like about it, on the UI as well as on the UX, that I would maybe do more design research and figure out what would be the best.

- *File directory expansion*: I focused primarly on entities that are supposed to be text files, but this can obviously be expanted to include images, the ability to multi select items and delete them more easily, the abilit to download one or more files as `.txt` files, a search input which would allow to better filter out the list etc.

- ‚úã *Being able to record video with the webcam*: The package I used to access and use the webcam probably has support for this, but the files would be too large to actually save to session storage. Databases would be good for this.

- ‚úã *Drag and drop app icons*: Add the ability to drag and drop icons to anywhere on the screen and somehow save the position if the user reloads the page.

- ‚úã *Usage of authorization to show/hide apps*: Maybe the customer wanted to limit the access to each app based on what subscription plan the user had. This would also be implemented with the help of backend.

- *Embedded markdown editor*: The ability to have full markdown support when trying to edit a text file.

- *Fullscreen image carousel/preview*: When a user would click on an image a fullscreen modal/popup/preview would appear allowing him/her to see the image clearly. Also adding support to use arrows on the side of the image to cycle through the images or use keyboard keys.

- ‚úã *Minimize windows to toolbar/multiple windows as once/resizing windows*: Due to how apps were implemented I doubt I could be able to have multiple modal opened at once and overlaying each other so this would need a more custom solution. Adding a minimize button to the window and the ability to be re-opened through the toolbar is something that could also be done. Resizing would as the first mentioned issue require a more custom solution.

- ‚úã *Right click menu*: Add a right click menu for renaming app names, creating a folder on the desktop etc.

- *Maps App*: Embedding a Google Maps type app where we can open maps in a window and use Google Maps features.

- *Adding animations/transitions*: Due to time constraints and focusing on implementing the core features I left out animations/transitions for things such as modals opening or collapsing/expanding the sidebar.

### Improvements

These improvements are mostly on how the code was written and where I had issues/what could be done better. There are probably bugs in the code, things written poorly or missing, which is why feedback would be required or code review for something this large.

- ‚úã *Test Coverage*: I sadly didn't write tests and this would be something I would need help with if the app had been much larger or even at this scale.

- ‚úã *Better ways of writing code*: Specific example would be how I handled sorting in the file directory table/list. I don't think that solution is close to elegant, I would talk to someone more experienced to see if there is a much simpler solution and a much cleaner one. Same goes for CSS, there are certain sections that I think could be written better with some review/talk on how to write them. This is also true for code which is unnecessary.

- *Not using open source libraries for modals/webcam access*: These two features could have been done in pure JS/CSS, but I opted to use third party libraries as to speed up development and have a more sure/tested way of implementation for what I needed.

- *Private routing*: Since the apps were being opened in modals I didn't really see a need for private routing. If the app icons would be treated as items in a sidebar navigation and each one would take the whole screen then I would be implementing each app as it's own route.

- *Mobile responsiveness*: The app sadly only supports medium sized or large screens. Maybe the mobile view would then move the toolbar to the upper part of the screen and have apps placed in a grid.
